`I’m a Junior Front-end/Web Developer.

On a daily basis, I create and maintain web applications for optimizing photos and videos (compression, conversion, resize, watermark etc. )   

Like in a sport which I love, new challenges is what makes me wanna work harder. The journey along the way is the most valuable.`
